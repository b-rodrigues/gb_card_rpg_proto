"""Dialogue-box placement ground-truth check (PyBoy).

On this ASCII-only branch the dialogue box is drawn into the BACKGROUND
tilemap (0x9800) at screen rows 12-17 via the console font -- the
window-layer dialogue box (f77ec9b) is a gfx-branch change.  The dialogue
overlays the frozen, camera-scrolled overworld (SCX/SCY are kept during
SCREEN_DIALOGUE), so the box is written at ring rows (12 + scroll_y)..(17 +
scroll_y) and the PPU shows it at screen rows 12-17.  The box must be
present, clean (no map tiles inside it), and the HUD window must be
disabled while the dialogue is up.

This boots the real release ROM headlessly, walks to the town guard (camera
scrolled, SCY > 0), triggers the dialogue by bumping the guard, and decodes
the actual BACKGROUND tilemap:

  1. dialogue-bg-box: the box is present in the background at screen rows
     12-17 at the expected shape (+ border, speaker, line, [A] CONTINUE).
  2. dialogue-clean: the box contains only dialogue text -- no map tiles
     mixed in.
  3. dialogue-window-hidden: the HUD window is disabled during dialogue.
  4. dialogue-second-line: pressing A advances to the later dialogue line.

The walk is POSITION-based, not press-count based.  PyBoy's fixed button
delays are lossy (an 8-tick hold drops ~30% of presses), and hold-to-move
commits a fresh move on the same frame the previous one lands (a held
button overshoots by one tile on walkable ground).  Instead, each step is a
single 1-tick press edge followed by a wait for the tile commit; the player
position is read back from WRAM after every press, so a dropped press is
re-pressed and the route self-corrects.

Run inside the Nix dev shell:
    nix develop --command python3 tools/vram_dialogue_check.py [--rom PATH]

Exits non-zero if any check fails.
